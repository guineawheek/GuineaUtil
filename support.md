I think these get gregified in GTNH and wouldn't really be useful, but may try anyway

* AE2 shaped/shapeless handler
* IC2 shaped/shapeless handler

* Bartworks
 - BW Ores


These aren't super useful for crafting calculators but may be useful for other reference:

* TT Research and EM Scanner
* Gendustry Mutagen Producer...?
* EnderIO machines

# Won'tfix (maybe future?)

* IC2 recipes (disabled in GTNH)
* TConstruct handlers (not super useful post-HV, only really use it for glue)
* AE2 machines (gregified)
